Click on this link to predict final exam score based on your performances on test 1, test 2, and test 3 in the (MAT-1140) Introduction to Statistics class: [Predict Score](https://amlanbanerjee.shinyapps.io/mat1140_finalscore_predict/)


The prediction is based on the following multivariate regression model, which was estimated using Bayesian method. The posterior distribution of the model parameters are shown in the figure below.   

$$ MODEL: final = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * test_1 + \beta_2 * test_2 + \beta_3 * test_3 $$
